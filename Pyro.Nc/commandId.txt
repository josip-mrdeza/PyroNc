//You can tweak, add, or remove commands from this file as you wish.
//To add comments for yourself use a prefix '//'.
//Command ids begin with an integer ID, ex. (00) for G0/G00; Arbitrary commands do not require this since none of them contain an integer ID in their string id.
//'##{SUFIX}' where 'SUFIX' is either 'G', 'M', or 'A' for GCommand, ModularCommand, ArbitraryCommand is used for notation the of a command sequence's end, and has to be used in order for the ValueStorage type to read the elements properly.
