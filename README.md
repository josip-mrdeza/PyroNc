# Pyro
A Collection of libraries, mostly used for PyroNc, a G-code simulation software I'm building.

# Pyro.IO.Mods
>Intended for adding plugins to .NET software at runtime.

# Pyro.IO
>A library consisting of many uses, ranging from manual memory management, performance optimisations, LINQ, System IO, Network IO, Unmanaged Collections, Marshalling, Interop, etc...

# Pyro.Math
>Provides various methods for calculating newton's forces (Pyro.Math.Physics), Plotting the points of a circle based on the n number of points, Plotting lines ( segmented into n parts ), and other basic mathemathical functions such as Sin, Cos, Tan, Arc_Sin, Arc_Cos, Arc_Tan...

# Pyro.Nc
>The core of Pyro; This assembly contains code required to manage the entire milling/turning simulation inside of unity.
Ranging from GCODE Parsers, Executors to many custom tailored algorithms for milling and turning including paralellisation, making use of multiple threads to finish a task quicker.
